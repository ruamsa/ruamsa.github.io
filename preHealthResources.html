                <h1>ScioVirtual</h1>
                <p>Hey AMSA! We are ScioVirtual, a new club here at Rutgers!</p>
                <p>We have an interesting opportunity for both volunteering and leadership. We know that the American Medical 
                    Student Association has a lot of members looking for hours and experiences to put on their resumes... or 
                    in this case probably extracurriculars for applications. A few of us are actually pre-meds and a part of 
                    your club!</p>
                <p>Our club is a branch of the ScioVirtual Foundation (https://sciovirtual.org), a live learning platform that 
                    provides affordable and quality STEM courses to thousands of middle and high school registrants. Essentially, 
                    there are multiple courses where college students experienced in that subject can teach students. So far, 
                    the foundation has raised over 20k for COVID hunger relief!  We are currently looking for more instructors 
                    and board members for our chapter.</p>
                <p>As a teacher, you would need to dedicate some of your time each week-- approximately 1 hour per week, for 
                    11 weeks, unless you would like to teach more than one course. Existing courses also have materials and 
                    curriculums, making teaching easier than ever! This is a great way to become a mentor to students, 
                    accumulate volunteer hours, get a good leadership position for a resume/future applications, develop 
                    teaching skills and experience, learn how to work with others, and make a difference in the world and the 
                    lives of others. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLx8L3TiJd2ylPcyD1GvQDorjor1NUhu/view?usp=sharing"

                <h1>UWorld Discount</h1>
                <p>We have partnered with UWorld to provide students with a discount. As you may know, UWorld is crucial
                    in studying for the MCAT. It may be even expensive for some students. Due to this reason, UWorld is
                    providing us a discount! We would love to help out more students so please pass
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5um_wfr7I6KDr5FnUqINVsTQLe5J31QGFuT478EDIHzqhnw/viewform"

                    on to any students that may be interested in getting a discount from UWorld for their MCAT prep.
                    They do not
                    have to use the subscription right away either and can save it for later in the future as well :)

                <h1>NJ Youth Leaders in Medicine</h1>
                <p>NJ Youth Leaders in Medicine provides virtual shadowing and volunteering opportunities, as well as
                    information on different medical careers and live-streams with health professionals. They aim to
                    spread useful information and help students in their endeavors to go into the field of medicine.
                    Their goal is to help students that have had opportunities taken away from them due to the pandemic,
                    underprivileged students, and students just wanting to learn more about the medical field. Check out
                    their Instagram page,

                    with various healthcare and volunteering opportunities. As an RWJ partner, their job is very
                    important right now since the pandemic has caused a serious depletion of blood in healthcare. It is
                    an urgent matter, and your potential involvement in their organization would be a great opportunity
                    to get involved on campus and help others!

                <h1>MCAT 101 Volunteering</h1>
                <p>
                    MCAT 101 is a new platform designed to engage students in the process of their prep and encourage
                    them to learn from each other and have fun! Students often spend hundreds and thousands of dollars
                    during this time when these resources could be provided for free and learned from one another. Here
                    at MCAT 101, we are trying to create an organization to provide free tutoring services and resources
                    for students.
                </p>
                <p>You do not have to be interested in the MCAT at all to even help though! If you are interested in any
                    volunteer/internship opportunities for the fall, we have a place for you. Some opportunities may be
                    in our premed blog, running our account as a student support team, answering any science questions
                    students may have, editing our website, or even developing our team further through business. You
                    can see more information on our website
